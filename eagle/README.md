Breakout versions:

* v0.1: initial version based on a 74LS595
* v0.2: correct labeling of numitron pins, rotate numitron to face flat (I hope)
* v0.3: a higher current shift register
* v0.4: break out debug header into two to provide safer routing, move to a design block for the numitron

Clock versions:

* v0.1: (based on v0.4 breakout)
